# Applied-Predictive-Modeling

Solutions for the exercises contained within APM can be found in this repository (please see http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/ for more information). The solutions encompassed within this repository were written in RStudio (see https://www.rstudio.com/).

Lastly, it is important to note that these solutions are not entirely my own, and thus credits should also be given to @Max Kuhn and @Kjell Johnson (https://waxworksmath.com/Authors/G_M/Kuhn/kuhn.html) who in 2014 worked on solving the exercises provided in APM.
